Check out some of my recent projects and see how I've applied my skills to create innovative solutions.

### SWE Simulation on Forage
- **Description**: Completed a simulation focused on the process of completing an engineering ticket for a system in the credit-card rewards department of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Fixed broken files in the repository to ensure the web application output correctly. Used JPMorgan Chaseâ€™s open-source library called Perspective to generate a live graph for traders to monitor data feeds. Set up a local development environment by downloading necessary files, tools, and dependencies, and created a new class to get an existing system up and running.
